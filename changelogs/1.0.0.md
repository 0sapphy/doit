# Changelog for Version 1.0.0

## Features Added
- **Admin Panel**: Introduced an admin panel to manage notifications.
  - Admins can push new notifications via a form.
  - Existing notifications are displayed with the option to delete them.

- **Notifications System**:
  - Added a notification system accessible via the navbar.
  - Notifications are fetched dynamically from the backend.
  - Users can mark notifications as read, and the read status is persisted using `localStorage`.
  - A red indicator appears on the notification icon for unread notifications.

- **Dynamic Suggestions**:
  - Implemented a suggestion system for task titles in the "Add a New Task" section.
  - Suggestions are fetched dynamically and displayed in a dropdown with a semi-transparent background.

- **Task Management**:
  - Users can add, update, and delete tasks.
  - Task statuses can be updated in real-time without refreshing the page.
  - The "Your Tasks" section is hidden when no tasks are available.

## UI/UX Enhancements
- **Theme Updates**:
  - Updated the background of all pages to a gradient (`bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-700 via-gray-800 to-gray-900`) for a modern look.
  - Adjusted text and input colors to ensure readability on the darker background.

- **Navbar Enhancements**:
  - Added a notification modal with animations for opening and closing.
  - Animated the "DOIT" logo in the navbar using `anime.js`.

- **Admin Panel Styling**:
  - Styled the admin panel to match the theme of other pages.
  - Added a responsive layout for the admin panel.

## Backend Changes
- **Notification API**:
  - Added a `POST /api/notifications` endpoint for admins to push new notifications.
  - Added a `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` endpoint for admins to delete notifications.

- **Authentication Enhancements**:
  - Added an `isAdmin` middleware to restrict access to admin-only routes.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the "Delete" button in the admin panel failed to delete notifications due to a missing backend route.
- Resolved a bug where the "Show Suggestions" toggle state was not persisted across page refreshes.

## Miscellaneous
- Removed all comments from the codebase for cleaner production-ready files.
- Added a footer to all pages for consistency, including version information and a GitHub link.
